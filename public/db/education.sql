(4, 'NUS Business Dean''s & Mochtar Riady Scholarships', 'Eligibility Criteria \r\n\r\nScholarship applicants must be students of the Business School (either Business Administration or Business Administration (Accountancy)) to be eligible. For double degree, applicants must have Business as their home faculty and Business Administration or Business Administration (Accountancy) as their primary degree. Scholarship recipients must meet all continuation requirements as stipulated for NUS Undergraduate Scholarships, which currently require that recipients maintain a Cumulative Average Point (CAP) of 3.5 (out of 5.0; "B" average). If a scholarship recipient meets the continuation requirements but does not complete the BBA program (e.g., by transferring out of the Business School), the School may impose a repayment on a case-by-case basis. Students who are dropped from the Scholarship for failure to meet any continuation requirement shall not be required to repay any Scholarship money already disbursed.\r\n\r\nTenure & Benefits\r\n\r\nSuperior incoming students, both local and international, are offered scholarships covering tuition fees (For AY2008/09 cohort, prevailing subsidised tuition fee for different categories is covered. For AY2009/10 cohort and after, students will be covered at the prevailing subsidised tuition fee rate for Singapore Citizens for the regular semesters and S$400 of monthly allowance (S$4800 yearly) for up to 5 years in total. This coverage of tutition fees extends solely to the undergraduate programmes only. Should the scholarship holder be enrolled in any double degree or concurrent degree programmes, he/she shall have to bear the additional difference in tuition and miscellaneous fees inccured for enrolment in these programmes. There will be a S$2000 start-up allowance for the first year only, therefore valuing the scholarship of up to S$63,450 over 5 years.. This rate is standard across all categories of students, so students coming in on international tuition fee rates will have to top up the additional amount on their own. There is no need to apply; an eligible student will be automatically invited for the required interview after submitting an online application for NUS admission. Interviews may be conducted between April and May. Selected students will be offered the scholarships conditional on their successful admission into NUS.\r\n\r\nBBA students are awarded for up to 3 years, BBA (Honours) students for up to 4 years, and double-degree (Bachelor + Bachelor) or concurrent-degree (Bachelor + Master) students for up to 5 years. The scholarship does not carry a bond, i.e., there are no strings attached. A number of these scholarships are reserved for superior international students who could have gained admissions to, or are already in, top universities elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe scholarship will cover the subsidised portion of the tuition fees payable by the students. These fees are highly subsidised and the subsidy comes in the form of a tuition grant. Hence, recipients of the scholarship will still have to take up the tuition grant from the Ministry of Education (MOE). Scholarship holders will still need to secure the MOE Tuition Grant on their own, just like for all students without this scholarship.Any required application for this generous Singapore Government subsidy will be included in the admission package.\r\n\r\nThe disbursement for the scholarship allowance each year will be processed only when the final results of each semester is released. Local and international applicants, who are not selected for this Scholarship, will be automatically considered for the NUS Business Study Award.\r\n\r\nStudents awarded the scholarship are required to contact the Scholarship Manager at the BBA Office, located at BIZ 1, Room 2-7 at the Mochtar Riady Building, within the first two weeks after the matriculation/registration exercise to confirm your acceptance of the scholarship.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConditions \r\n\r\n    Scholars are not allowed to hold any other scholarship/award unless it is meant to cover the extra expenses incurred for an overseas programme conducted by a partner University.\r\n    Each scholar''s academic performance is reviewed at the end of every semester. Scholarship recipients must meet all continuation requirements as stipulated for NUS Undergraduate Scholarships, which currently require that recipients maintain a Cumulative Average Point (CAP) of 3.5 (out of 5.0; or a ''B'' Average)\r\n    If the scholar decides to terminate the scholarship prematurely, the University reserves the right to impose repayment on a case-by-case basis.\r\n    Should scholars make a faculty (i.e. out of the Business School) switch during the course of their undergraduate study, the Dean’s Scholarship will be terminated and the University reserves the right to impose repayment for such cases.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nApplication is open to all new students who have been offered a place in the NUS Business School.\r\nSuccessful applicants will be notified via an official email from the BBA Admissions Team.', 'National University of Singapore', 'Faculty of Law\r\nNational University of Singapore\r\nEu Tong Sen Building\r\n469G Bukit Timah Road\r\nSingapore 259776\r\n\r\nTelephone: +65 6516 1305\r\nFacsimile: +65 6779 0979\r\n', '2014-09-13', '2014-09-11', '2014-11-28', 1);
